\section{Introduction}
  
	Linear regression is used to predict value of a variable based on the value of another one. The variable used to predict the other one is called \textit{Independent variable} (or sometimes, it might be called \textit{predictor variable}). The predicted variable is called \textit{dependent variable} (or sometimes, it might be called \textit{the outcome variable}).
	
    For example, you can use linear regression to predict the population of a country based on the population of previous years or maybe you can predict a person's height depends on their weight...
    
    In case we have more than one independent variable, we have to use multiple regression.
    
\section{The model behind linear regression} 
	\textit{Simple linear regression} model includes the \textit{mean function}(1) and the \textit{variance function}(2). 
	\begin{align}
            &E = (Y|X=x) = \beta _{0} + \beta _{1} x \\
            &Var(Y|X=x) = \sigma ^ {2}
    \end{align}
    In this line, Y is the output variable we want to predict, X is the input variable we know, $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ are the coefficients we need to estimate that can move the line around.
    
    The parameters in the \textit{mean function} (1) are the intercept ${\beta _{0}}$ and the slope ${\beta_{1}}$. The intercept is the value of ${E(Y |X = x)}$ when x equals to zero (\textit{in machine learning, it is called the bias, because it is added to offset all predictions}) and the slope is defined by the change in ${E(Y |X = x)}$ for a unit change in X. The parameters are usually unknown and must be estimated by using data. By changing the parameters, we can get all possible straight lines.

            \draw [line width=1.5, red] (0,0)--(0,0.75) node[right] {${\beta _{0}}$}; 
            \draw [line width=1.5, blue] (2,1.7)--(3,1.7) node[left] {${}$}; 
            \draw [line width=1.5, blue] (3,1.7)--(3,2.175) node[right] {${\beta _{1}}$};

        \textit{Equation of a straight line ${E(Y|X=x)=\beta _{0} + \beta _{1} x}$} 
    \end{center}
    
    In fact, we can not accurately determine the parameter $\beta_{0}$ or $\beta_{1}$ because it is unknown but only estimated by using data. By changing the parameters, we can get all possible straight lines. That is why the general equation we have a certain error. Therefore, we will process and get results from data to the overall estimate. 
	
    The simplest way to explain is to suppose we have a data set with x and y values that make a lot of points on the graph, and through these points, we can plot many linear lines to show the relationship linearity between x and y, but we can only choose \textbf{one} line that best represents of this relationship, corresponding to the fact that we have only make a single linear regression equation.

    The \textit{variance function} (2) is assumed to be constant, with a positive value ${\sigma ^ {2}}$ that is usually unknown. When ${\sigma ^ {2} > 0}$, the observed value of the ${i^{th}}$ response ${y_{i}}$ will not equal to its expected value ${E(Y|X=x_{i})}$. To explain the difference between the observed data and the expected value, we have to make a quantitative called a statistical error or ${e_{i}}$= ${y_{i}}$ - ${E(Y|X=x_{i})}$. 
    
    The errors ${e_{i}}$ depend on unknown parameters in the mean function and so are not observable quantities.

\section{Statistical Hypotheses}
    If we make assumptions when the chief null hypothesis is ${H_{0}}$: ${B_{1} = 0}$ (i.e the equation ${E(Y|X=x)}$ is parallel to the horizontal axis) and the corresponding alternative hypothesis is ${H_{1}}$: ${B_{1} = 0}$ (i.e the equation ${E(Y|X=x)}$ is not parallel to the horizontal axis or ${H_{1}}$ is negative. by ${H_{0}}$). If ${H_{0}}$ is true, we can conclude that for every variable x, it has no effect on Y. 
    \\
    
    For \textbf{Figure 3.1}, we might expect the straight-line to be appropriate but with ${B_{1} = 0}$. If the slope is zero, then the line is parallel to the horizontal axis. We will test for independence of x and y by testing the hypothesis that ${\beta_{1} = 0}$ against the alternative hypothesis that ${\beta_{1} = 0}$.

    Sometimes it is reasonable to choose a different null hypothesis for ${B_{1}}$. For example, if ${x}$ is some \textbf{gold standard} for a particular measurement, i.e., a best-quality measurement often involving great expense, and y is some cheaper substitute, then the obvious null hypothesis is ${B_{1} = 1}$ with alternative ${B_{1} != 1}$.

\section{Regression calculation} 
    There are many methods for obtaining estimates of parameters in a model. The method we are discussing here is called ordinary least squares (or OLS), in which parameter estimates are chosen to minimize a quantity called \textit{\textbf{the residual sum of squares (RSS)}}.
    
    The table 5.1 will show all formulas that we use to calculate the two parameters: ${\beta_{0}}$ and ${\beta_{1}}$

        \textit{A schematic plot for OLS fitting. Each data point is indicated by a small symbol. Points below the line have negative residuals, while points above the line have positive residuals.}
    \end{center}
    
    The OLS estimates are those values ${\beta_{0}}$ and ${\beta_{1}}$ that minimize the function. We call the quantity RSS${ \left (\hat{\beta}_{0},{\hat{\beta}_{1}} \right)}$ the \textit{residual sum of squares} or just RSS.
    
    \begin{align}
        RSS(\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}) = \displaystyle \sum _{i = 1} ^ {N}   |y_{i} - (\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{i})| ^ 2
     \end{align}
    
    One of method to find the minimum is differentiate with respect to $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$, and make them equal $0$. 
     
    \begin{align} 
        \dfrac{\partial RSS(\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}) }{\beta_{0}} = -2 \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}  (y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \beta_{1} x_{i}) = 0
        \\
        \dfrac{\partial RSS(\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}) }{\beta_{1}} = -2 \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}  x_{i} (y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \beta_{1} x_{i}) = 0
    \end{align}
        
    From (11), (12) we get (13) and (14) like this: 
    
    \begin{align} 
        \beta_{0} n + \beta_{1} \displaystyle \sum x_{i} = \displaystyle \sum y_{i}
        \\
        \beta_{0} \displaystyle \sum x_{i} + \beta_{1} \displaystyle \sum x_{i}^2 = \displaystyle \sum x_{i} y_{i}
    \end{align}
    
    Using fomulars: 
    
     \begin{align} 
        SXX &= \Sigma (x_{i} - \overline{x})^2 \\
        &= \Sigma x_{i}^2 - 2 \Sigma x_{i} \overline{x} + n\overline{x}^2  \nonumber \\
        &= \Sigma x_{i}^2 - 2 \Sigma x_{i} \dfrac{\Sigma x_{i}}{n} + n\dfrac{\Sigma x_{i} \Sigma x_{i}}{n^2}   \nonumber \\
        &= \Sigma x_{i}^2 - \dfrac{\Sigma x_{i} \Sigma x_{i}}{n} \nonumber \\
        &= \Sigma x_{i}^2 - n\dfrac{\Sigma x_{i} \Sigma x_{i}}{n n} \nonumber \\
        &= \Sigma x_{i}^2 - n\overline{x}^2 \nonumber \\
        SXY &= \Sigma (x_{i} - \overline{x})(y_{i} - \overline{y}) = \Sigma x_{i}y_{i} - n\overline{x}\overline{y}
    \end{align}
    
    Solving (13), (14), we get:
    
    \begin{align} 
        \beta_{0} &n + \beta_{1} \Sigma x_{i} = \Sigma y_{i}                \nonumber \\
        \beta_{0} &= \dfrac {\Sigma y}{n} - \beta_{1}  \dfrac {\Sigma x}{n} \nonumber \\
        \beta_{0} &= \overline{y} - \beta_{1}  \overline{x}                 \\
        \nonumber \\
        \nonumber \\
        \beta_{0} &\Sigma x_{i} + \beta_{1} \Sigma x_{i}^2 = \Sigma x_{i} y_{i} \nonumber \\
        \beta_{1} &= \dfrac{\Sigma x_{i}y_{i} - \beta _{0} \Sigma x_{i} }{ \Sigma x_{i}^2} \nonumber \\
        \beta_{1} &= \left ( \dfrac{\Sigma x_{i}y_{i}}{\Sigma x_{i}^2} - \dfrac{\Sigma x_{i} \Sigma y_{i}}{n \Sigma x_{i}^2} \right ) 
        \dfrac{n \Sigma x_{i}^2}{n\Sigma x_{i}^2 - \Sigma x_{i} \Sigma x_{i}} \nonumber \\
        \beta_{1} &= \left ( \Sigma x_{i}y_{i} - \dfrac{\Sigma x_{i} \Sigma y_{i}}{n} \right ) 
        \dfrac{n}{n\Sigma x_{i}^2 - \Sigma x_{i} \Sigma x_{i}} \nonumber \\
        \beta_{1} &= \dfrac{n \Sigma x_{i} y_{i} - \Sigma x_{i} \Sigma y_{i}}{n \Sigma x_{i}^2 - \Sigma x_{i} \Sigma x_{i}} \nonumber \\
        \beta_{1} &= \dfrac{\Sigma x_{i} y_{i} - n \overline{x} \overline{y}}{n \Sigma x_{i}^2 - n \overline{x}^2} \nonumber \\
        \beta_{1} &= \dfrac{SXY}{SXX} = \dfrac
        {\displaystyle\sum(x_{i}-\overline{x})(y_{i}-\overline{y})}
        {\displaystyle \sum {\left(x_{i} - \overline{x}\right)}^2} 
        = r_{xy} \dfrac{SD_{x}}{SD_{y}}
    \end{align}
    
    The several forms for $\hat{\beta_{1}}$ are all equivalent.
    
    
    Using Forbes’ data from \textbf{Table 5.1}, we will write $\overline{x}$ as the sample mean of \textit{Temp} and $\overline{y}$ as the sample mean of \textit{Lpres}. The quantities needed for computing the least squares estimators are: 
    
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c c c}
            $\overline{x} = 202.95294118 $ & $SXX = 530.78235294 $ & $SXY = 475.31223529 $ \\
            $\overline{y} = 139.60529412 $ & $SYY = 427.79402353 $
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    
    In case regression calculations are not done by using statistical software or a statistical calculator, intermediate calculations such as these should be done as accurately as possible, and rounding should only be used for final results. Using the above-mentioned results, we can find
    
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c}
        ${\hat{\beta_{1}} = \dfrac{SXY}{SXX} = 0.895}$ \\
        ${\hat{\beta_{0}} = \overline{y} - \hat{\beta_{1}} \overline{x} = -42.138}$

\section {Interpreting Regression Coefficients} 
    Firstly, we need to analysis the correlation between x and y by using the correlation analyze method with the main formula is the correlation coefficient. The result of the formula just evaluates whether or not there is a linear relationship, whether this relationship is positive or negative, stable or not.  
    
    The formula of the correlation coefficient is given from the Co-variance formula - which is also a method of evaluating the relationship between two variables x and y - but has a major limitation for which Co-variance formula is often rarely used and instead by the correlation coefficient. Specifically:
    
    \begin{align} 
        s_{xy} = \dfrac{\Sigma{(x_{i} - \overline{x})(y_{i} - \overline{y})}}{n - 1}\nonumber
    \end{align}
    
    For example, we have a sample data about the number of ad campaigns on Facebook per week for 10 weeks and how many million revenue cost (units of 1000 VND) are received, where x will be the number of campaigns per week, y is the sales


    \begin{center}
        \textbf{Table 6.1:} the number of ad campaigns on Facebook per week for 10 weeks
        
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
            \hline 
            Week & Ad campaign & revenue cost  \\
            \hline
                1 & 2 & 4900 \\
                2 & 3 & 5100 \\ 
                3 & 5 & 5500 \\
                4 & 4 & 5100 \\
                5 & 1 & 3900 \\
                6 & 1 & 3600 \\
                7 & 3 & 4700 \\
                8 & 4 & 5500 \\
                9 & 2 & 4500 \\ 
                10 & 5 & 6000 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    
    Next, we will apply the above-mentioned formula to calculate the co-variance is 1022. From there, we will divide the graph into 4 parts.

            };
            \end{axis}  
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    
    Interpret the results: 
    
    The line in which value ${x = 4}$ is the average value over 10 weeks, the y line of ${10}$-week average revenue. This line divides the graph into four parts. Part 1 will have x value greater than average of ${x}$, ${y}$ greater than mean of y. Part 2 will have x value less than the mean of x and value of y greater than the mean of y. Similar to parts 3 and 4.
    
    Therefore, we can see (${x}$ - ${\overline{x}}$)(${y}$ - ${\overline{y}}$) will be positive with parts 1 and 3 but negative with parts 2 and 4. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If ${S_{xy}}$ is positive, the points are mostly in parts $1$ and $3$, a positive linear relationship. 
        \item If ${S_{xy}}$ is negative, the points are mostly in parts $2$ and $4$, a negative linear relationship. 
        \item If the points are completely divided equally into ${4}$ parts then ${S_{xy}}$ will be $0$ and there is no linear relationship between x and y. 
    \end{itemize}
    
    Looking on the graph we can see that 7/10 points are in parts 1 and 3 corresponding to positive S. From there, we can confirm that x and y have a linear relationship, which means that the advertising campaign increases, revenue also increases.

         \textbf{Figure 7.1} Sample residual versus fit plots for testing equal variance
    \end{center}
    
    A plot of all residuals on the y-axis versus. the predicted values on the x-axis, called a residual versus fit plot, is a good way to check the linearity and equal variance assumptions. The fixed-x assumption can not be checked with residual analysis (or any other data analysis). 
    
     To analyze a residual vs. fit plot, such as any of the examples shown in \textbf{Figure 7.1}, you should mentally divide it up into about $5$ to $10$ vertical stripes (in here we will divide it into $5$ vertical stripes). Then each stripe represents all of the residuals for a number of subjects who have a similar predicted values.
     
     To check the linearity assumption, consider that for each $x$ value, if the mean of $Y$ falls on a straight line, then the residuals have a mean of \textbf{zero}. If we incorrectly fit a straight line to a curve, then some or most of the predicted means are incorrect, and this causes the residuals for at least specific ranges of $x$ (or the predicated $Y$ ) to be \textbf{non-zero} on average. Specifically if the data follow a simple curve, we will tend to have either a pattern of high then low then high residuals or the reverse. So the technique used to detect non-linearity in a residual vs. fit plot is to find the (vertical) mean of the residuals for each vertical stripe. 
     
     If the resultant connected segments or curve is close to a horizontal line at 0 on the y-axis, then we have no reason to doubt the linearity assumption. If there is a clear curve, most commonly a “smile” or “frown” shape, then we suspect non-linearity. 
     
     Four examples are shown in figure 7.1. In each band the mean residual is marked, and lines segments connect these. Plots A and B show no obvious pattern away from a horizontal line other that the small amount of expected “noise”. Plots C and D show clear deviations from normality, because the lines connecting the mean residuals of the vertical bands show a clear frown (C) and smile (D) pattern, rather than a flat line.
